Welcome to the Klipper project!

Klipper is a 3d-Printer firmware. It combines the power of a general
purpose computer with one or more micro-controllers. See the
[features document](https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html) for more
information on why you should use Klipper.

To begin using Klipper start by
[installing](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html) it.

Klipper is Free Software. See the [license](COPYING) or read the
[documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html). We depend on
the generous support from our
[sponsors](https://www.klipper3d.org/Sponsors.html).

This fork is dedicated to using Klipper on the Monoprice Ultimate v2.  The Monoprice Ultimate v1
may be compatible as well however, the Z axis will need to be edited for that model.  Monoprice
Ultimate v2 supports a Z axis maximum of 170mm and the v1 supports a maximum of 165mm.
(***If memory serves, please confirm before mashing the hot end into the print bed :(***)

(***PLEASE NOTE, THE PRINTER USED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FORK WAS PHYSICALLY MODIFIED***)
I have modified my Ultimate slightly by adding a spring-steel bed plate to the metal/glass bonded
bed plate.  The spring-steel plate is secured by an adhesive-backed magnetic substrate adhered
to the standard Monoprice plate.

(***See comments in printer.cfg and macro config files for additional information***)
